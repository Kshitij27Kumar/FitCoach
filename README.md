## üîß Technical Implementation

### AI Integration

FitCoach uses direct OpenAI API calls for reliable performance:

```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
      { role: "user", content: userInput },
    ],
    max_tokens: 1000,
    temperature: 0.7,
  }),
});
```

### Theme System

Smooth dark/light mode transitions with CSS custom properties:

```typescript
// Theme toggle
const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false);

// Apply theme to body
useEffect(() => {
  document.body.className = isDarkMode ? "dark-mode" : "light-mode";
}, [isDarkMode]);
```

### Responsive Design

Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific styling:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .app {
    border-radius: 0;
    min-height: 100vh;
  }

  .suggestion-chips {
